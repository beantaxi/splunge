# splunge
Splunge is designed to be the world's easiest Python Web framework. Pyramid and Django are fine, but they are not ruthlessly simple.

Splunge is ruthlessly simple.

- getting started -

Install splunge (with pip or whatever; I guess I might need an egg or something for this, or run a private pypy)
Create a folder
Run the splunge startup script
Make files and folders and such

#### Todo
* Include a sample app!
** HTML
** Plain ole python
** Templated python, with ... mako or whatever it is I ended up using for templating
* Improve the startup experience
** Favor pip install, even if it is the distro (e.g. pip install ~/dev/git/splunge)
** Consider including gunicorn in the distro, to be completely self-contained
*** Licensing?
*** Would this actually work?
** See if it's possible to put the run commands on the path, as part of the installation (perhaps this can be part of pip install)
