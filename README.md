# splunge
Splunge is designed to be the world's easiest Python Web framework. Pyramid and Django are fine, but they are not ruthlessly simple.

Splunge is ruthlessly simple.

- getting started -

Install splunge (with pip or whatever; I guess I might need an egg or something for this, or run a private pypy)
Create a folder
Run the splunge startup script
Make files and folders and such

* Include a sample app! *
