# splunge
Splunge is designed to be the world's easiest Python Web framework. Pyramid and Django are fine, but they are not ruthlessly simple.

Splunge is ruthlessly simple.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/beantaxi/splunge`
2.  `virtualenv ~/dev/venv/splunge-test`
3.  `pip install splunge`
4. `cd sample-site`
5. `www`

This will run splunge inside the sample web site - the sample web site will be online!

Some URLs to visit (or curl)
- https://localhost:1313/index.html
- https://localhost:1313/set-underscore
- https://localhost:1313/some-values
- https://localhost:1313/write-to-stdout

#### Todo
1. Add a `.pyp` page to the sample
